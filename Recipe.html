    <h1>How to make a sweet and spiced Somali tea</h1>
   
    <h2>
      Somali tea is very special. Although everyone uses similar ingredients,
      Somali tea tastes different in every home. See below for the ingredients
      and steps needed to make this sweet and delicious tea.
    </h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>6 cups of water</li>
      <li>2 whole cloves</li>
      <li>4 green cardamom pods</li>
      <li>One (3- to 4-inch) cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>3 1/4 ounces unpeeled fresh ginger, or to taste</li>
      <li>1/3 cup (67 grams) granulated sugar, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon loose leaf black tea or 2 tea bags</li>
      <li>
        Powdered milk, such as Nestle Nido brand, or fresh milk of choice
        (optional)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to making the tea.</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          In a medium pot over medium-high heat, bring the water to a boil.
          While waiting for the water to boil, in a mortar with a pestle, pound
          the cloves, cardamom and cinnamon until roughly ground. Alternatively,
          place the spices in a spice grinder and process until roughly ground.
          Add the ground spices to the water.
        </li>

        <li>
          Slice the ginger root into 1/4-inch thick pieces. Working with a few
          pieces at a time, smash the ginger in a mortar and pestle until all
          pieces are smashed (you can also smash with a meat tenderizer or a
          kitchen mallet). Add the ginger to the water, followed by the sugar
          and tea, and bring to a boil.
        </li>

        <li>
          Once the mixture comes to a boil, turn off the heat and let the tea
          steep on the burner for 10 to 15 minutes. Strain into cups and serve
          with milk of your choice, if desired.
        </li>
      </ol>
